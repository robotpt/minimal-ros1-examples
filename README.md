> This has only been tested in Kinetic.

This project contains several minimal examples of core things that you might do in an application that uses ROS1 (Robot Operating System).  

To use, make sure that you have ROS setup.  To do the web example, you will need to install additional things for web hosting, see the package's readme.

For best practices, on when to use what in ROS, see [here](https://github.com/leggedrobotics/ros_best_practices/wiki).

Happy coding!
